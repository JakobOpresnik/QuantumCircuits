# QuantumCircuits

generating equally distributed random non-negative integers using Hadamard &amp; rotational gates, using 29-qubit quantum simulators by using Python's Qiskit library

generators were also run different amounts of times to show that more iterations yield increasingly more equally distributed random non-negative integers, whereas too few iterations do not generate such equal distribution

I also tested IBM's remote 127-qubit quantum simulator, using the IBM Kyoto backend provider

see `main.ipynb` for the full report
